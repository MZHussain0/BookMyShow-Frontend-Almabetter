## Technologies

- Frontend Techstack - `React`, `Typescript` `Tailwindcss`, `@tanstack/react-Query`, `Axios`, `Vite`, `Shadcn UI`.
- Backend TechStack - `Node`, `Express`, `MongoDB`, `Mongoose`, `MVC Pattern`

## Approach

- Planning Phase:

  - Wireframing the website's structure and layout.
  - Select a color scheme and design elements that align with the brand image.
  - Determine the technology stack and tools needed to build the website.

- Development Phase:
  - Install the necessary dependencies and set up the local dev environment.
  - Backend Dev:
    - Designed a schema for the required use case.
    - Developed the controllers and routes for APIs : `POST` `/api/booking` & `GET` `/api/booking`.
    - Created the mongoDb instance and connected it to the application.
    - Deployed the backend on `render.com` and made it communicate with the frontend app.
  - Frontend Dev:
    - Set up the React app using `Vite`, `TailwindCss`, and `Typescript`. Integrated `Shadcn UI` for reusable components.
    - Set up the global persist store with `Zustand`. Zustand store will persist the movies, slots, and seats in global states using Zustand middleware `PersistStorage`.
    - Client-side validation and data fetching with the help of `@tanstack/react-query` and `Axios`. Integrating loading state, Success state, and error state using `@tanstack/react-query`
    - After testing the application thoroughly, deployed it on Vercel.
